; local region changes for Enable OSSL functions.
; copy this file to osslEnable.ini, unless you already have one with local changes that are still valid for current opensim version.
; this file is included from osslDefaultEnable.ini file where defaults are defined, and allows to override them
; to not edit that file, copy the line you want to change to this file, then edit here
; see osslDefaultEnable.ini and
; http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Category:OSSL_Functions for a description of OSSL functions

; do not delete this line;
[OSSL]
  ; Allow the use of os* functions (some are always available)
  ;AllowOSFunctions = true

  ; Allow the user of mod* functions.  This allows a script to pass messages
  ;   to a region module via the modSendCommand() function and is used by some
  ;   modules to extend the scripting language.
  ;AllowMODFunctions = true

  ; Allow the use of LightShare functions.
  ; The setting enable_windlight = true must also be enabled in the [LightShare] section.
  ;AllowLightShareFunctions = true

  ; Send function permission error to owner if true, to all if false
  ;PermissionErrorToOwner = false
  
  ; Function Threat level
  ; Several functions have a predefined threat level, one of:  None, VeryLow, Low, Moderate, High, VeryHigh, Severe.
  ; See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Threat_level for more information on these levels.
  ; Blanket enabling the ossl functions is dangerous and we do not recommend setting higher
  ;   than 'Low' unless you have a high level of trust in all the users that can run scripts
  ;   in your simulator.  It is safer to explicitly allow certain types of user to run
  ;   higher threat level OSSL functions, as detailed later on.
  ; This setting defines the highest level allowed to execute
  OSFunctionThreatLevel = VeryLow

  ; The threat level can be replaced by more detailed rules by lines of the form
  ; Allow_FunctionName = parameters
  ; To use the default threat level coment the respective line
  ; parameters can be:
  ; 'false' disables the function.
  ; 'true' enables for everyone
  ;  or to enable for individuals or groups, set it to a comma separated list. This checks
  ;    against the owner of the object containing the script.
  ;    The comma separated entries in the list may be one of:
  ;           "GRID_GOD" -- enable for users with UserLevel >= 200
  ;           "GOD" -- enable for users with rights to be god (local or grid)
  ;           "ACTIVE_GOD" -- enable for users that are present and with active god power
  ;           "ESTATE_MANAGER" -- enable for estate manager
  ;           "ESTATE_OWNER" -- enable for estate owner
  ;           "PARCEL_OWNER" -- enable for parcel owner
  ;           "PARCEL_GROUP_MEMBER" -- enable for any member of the parcel group
  ;           uuid -- enable for specified ID (may be avatar or group ID)
  ;    from this we can also create macros that can be include in the list as
  ;    ${OSSL|macroname} see examples below

  ; parcel macros
  ; Allowing ossl functions for anyone owning a parcel can be dangerous especially if
  ;    a region is selling or otherwise giving away parcel ownership. By default, parcel
  ;    ownership or group membership does not enable OSSL functions. Uncomment the
  ;    appropriate line below to allow parcel ownership and groups to do restricted
  ;    OSSL functions. It might be better to check the list below and edit the ones
  ;    to enable individually.
  osslParcelO = ""
  osslParcelOG = ""
  ; osslParcelO = "PARCEL_OWNER,"
  ; osslParcelOG = "PARCEL_GROUP_MEMBER,PARCEL_OWNER,"

  ; NPC macros
  ; These can be mis-used so limit use to those you can trust.
  osslNPC = ${OSSL|osslParcelOG}ESTATE_MANAGER,ESTATE_OWNER
  
  ; example
  ; Allow_osNpcCreate =               ${OSSL|osslNPC}
  
  ; The threat level also can be replaced by lines of the form
  ; Creators__FunctionName = comma separated list of UUIDs
  ; this will enable the function for users that are the script creators and owners of the prim

; *************************************************
; add lines with our region local changes, below this to replace the default on osslDefaultEnable.ini or code.
