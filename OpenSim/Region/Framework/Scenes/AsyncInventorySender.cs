    /// very large number of FetchInventory requests are sent to the simulator.  Each is handled on a separate thread
    /// by the IClientAPI, but the sheer number of requests overwhelms the number of threads available and ends up
    /// freezing the inbound packet handling.

    /// This class makes the first FetchInventory packet thread process the queue.  If new requests come
    /// in while it is processing, then the subsequent threads just add the requests and leave it to the original
    /// thread to process them.
    ///
    /// This might slow down outbound packets but these are limited by the IClientAPI outbound queues
    /// anyway.
